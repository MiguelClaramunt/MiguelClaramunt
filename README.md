### Hi there! 👋🏻 I'm Miguel

I'm a Data Scientist mainly interested in **Natural Language Processing** and **Algorithmic Fairness**. During my undergraduate studies I have conducted research related to fake news detection using BERT-based language models. Tangentially, I have also studied the different biases of such models and applied Explanable AI techniques.
